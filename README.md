## Problem Statement
      Create a single page application using AngularJS which has following views/functionalities -
       
        1) View 1 - A view to list all books, characters and houses in same ng-repeat. The data
        should be sorted in alphabetical order and one type of card(or <div>) like book should
        look different from <div> of character. Use custom directive to achieve this functionality
        2) View 2 - On clicking the div, a view containing the detail of that book/character/house
        should open containing all the information about it in details
        3) In View 1, create filters like sort (alphabetically reverse or forward), filter by name of
        author etc. You can think of more filters. Extra marks will be given for intuitive thinking
        in this section.
        
      You are allowed to create custom directives and custom filters and also allowed to use filters or
      modules available on internet. You can use angular module published by other authors.
     
      Host this code in a github repository as well and send the link of that repository in the
      submission.
